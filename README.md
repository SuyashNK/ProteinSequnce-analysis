# ProteinSequnce-analysis



## Introduction

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook file (`Benchmark Dataset 20bds029.ipynb`) created in Colaboratory. The notebook focuses on processing a benchmark dataset related to molecular biology. The main tasks include data parsing, feature extraction, and the development of a machine learning model.

## Content Overview

The notebook covers the following key components:

1. **Data Parsing**: Utilizing Python scripts (`parse_hmm` and `parse_pssm`), the notebook extracts information from text files in specified directories (`Benchmark_HMM` and `Benchmark_PSSM`). The parsed data is stored in Pandas DataFrames.

2. **Data Integration**: The parsed data is integrated into Pandas DataFrames (`hmm_df` and `pssm_df`) along with additional information from an external CSV file (`Benchmark_BinaryML.csv`). The final DataFrame (`final_df`) is created by merging these datasets.

3. **Word Embeddings**: Word embeddings are generated using Word2Vec and FastText models based on the sequences in the dataset. These embeddings are utilized as features for the machine learning model.

4. **Machine Learning Model**: A neural network model is defined and trained using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is designed for multi-label classification, predicting labels such as 'envelope,' 'lumen,' 'plastoglobule,' 'stroma,' and 'thylakoid_membrane.'

5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on a test set, and the accuracy metrics are reported.

6. **Strict Accuracy Calculation**: The notebook includes functions to compute strict accuracy for multi-label classification. The strict accuracy is then calculated and presented for the model's predictions.

7. **Results Export**: The strict accuracy results for each sequence are saved to a CSV file (`Strict_accuracies_Benchmark.csv`).

## Usage

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Upload the notebook (`Benchmark Dataset 20bds029.ipynb`) to your Colaboratory environment.
2. Ensure the required dependencies are installed.
3. Execute each cell in sequence.

Feel free to explore and adapt the notebook for your specific needs. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out.
